            I'm an interdisciplinary visual communication designer.

         <h3>
            I currently work on visualisation projects at <a href="http://science-practice.com">Science&nbsp;Practice</a>, and designing healthcare experiences at <a href="http://sp-ee.net">SP+EE</a>. Recently, I've been leading design work for <a href="http://bento.bio">bento&bull;lab</a>. From time to time, I also write articles, talk at conferences, run workshops, and teach.

         <h1>Writing for 2+3d</h1>
         <h3>
            <a href="http://2plus3d.pl/">2+3d Polish Design Quarterly</a> is the top design magazine in Central-Eastern Europe. Besides current articles about product and graphic design, it publishes interdisciplinary texts on broader topics, such as: design criticism, design economy, history of design, and technology.
         </h3>
         <h3>
            In 2015 I wrote two articles for 2+3d. In "Nieposłuszne Przedmioty" I reviewed the <a href="http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/exhibitions/disobedient-objects/">"Disobedient Object"</a> exhibition at the V&amp;A in London. In "Genetyczne Klocki" I wrote about synthetic biology and how designers become involved in it.

<!-- BENTO•LAB -->

         <h3>
            <a href="http://www.bento.bio/bento-lab/">bento&bull;lab</a> is a personal box-sized biological laboratory. It is equipped with a powerful 3d-printed centrifuge, a mini PCR machine, and a gel electrophoresis unit with an LED transilluminator. Everything fits in a portable A4-sized box.
         </h3>
         <h3>
            As part of the team developing the bento&bull;lab, I was responsible for bento's brand identity, user experience design, product design, as well as some elements of strategy and planning. Currently, the bento&bull;lab is in pioneer beta-testing.

<!-- VISWEEK -->
      {% if page.label == "visweek" %}
         <h1>Visual Design for Data Explorers</h1>
         <h3>
            Data scientists create new tools for exploring and making sense of huge sets of data generated by data-driven sciences (for example genomics or population health). Visualisation is often a key component of those tools. Yet, many data scientists lack important design skills to make good visualisation choices.
         </h3>
         <h3>
            I created a half-day hands-on workshop on the principles of visual design for data scientists. I taught it at two IEEEVis conferences in <a href="http://ieeevis.org/year/2012/tutorial/visweek/good-practice-visual-communication-design-scientific-and-data-visualizati">2012 (Seattle, WA)</a> and <a href="http://ieeevis.org/year/2013/tutorial/visweek/visualization-data-visual-interpretation-data-hands-design-tutorial">2013 (Atlanta, GA)</a>. The workshop includes a 90-minute background talk followed by a 120-minute sketching exercise, and a 30-minute discussion.

<!-- HUMAN FACTORS -->
      {% if page.label == "factors" %}
         <h1>Human Factors</h1>
         <h3>
            Human factors (or ergonomics) is the study of interactions between people and the things they use. It's impossible to design healthy, comfortable, efficient objects and environments without considering human factors.
         </h3>
         <h3>
            That's also the case with workspaces. In 2006 I conducted a human factors evaluation of a conference room for a Warsaw-based company. I took measurements and analysed key conflicts between the users, the architecture, and the equipment, and summarised my conclusions in a list of specific recommendations. Suggested improvements were aimed at significantly improving the human factors quality of the conference room, while keeping the number of changes to minimum.

<!-- IMMUNOGRAPHICS -->

         <h3>
            In 2011&ndash;2013 I worked with Immunocore to redesign and improve the ways they communicate their work outside the company. In close collaboration with their senior scientists I developed an illustration kit for building scientific visualisations of their anti-cancer T cell therapy. <!--technology. Informed by user research done with Immunocore's scientists I also built a set of modular templates for their conference posters and presentations. Finally, I also designed a new logo for Immunocore.-->
         </h3>
         <h3>
            Since then, Immunocore has started clinical trials for their ImmTAC cancer treatment, and made a series of huge business deals with top pharma players becoming one of the brightest biotech star in the UK.

<!-- SETI -->

         <h3>
            Are we alone in the Universe?
         </h3>
         <h3>
            "Lingua Extraterrestris" is my MA thesis and an exploration into the limits of communication. I'm interested in CETI &mdash; communication with extarterrestrial intelligence &mdash; because it is the most extreme example of all communication types. My investigation looks at historical and science-fiction examples of CETI, and discusses them in relation to prerequisites for any communication encounter: channel, contact, context, and code. In conclusion, I suggest to expand on the famous Drake equation using these four parameters.

<!-- MITOSIS & MEIOSIS -->
      {% if page.label == "mitosis" %}
         <h1>Mitosis and Meiosis</h1>
         <h3>
            "What is the most complex thing in biology that students have trouble understanding"? I asked this question to my former high-school biology teacher, Dr W&#322;odzimierz W&#243;jcik, when we started a collaboration project to redesign visualisation aids he used in his class. "Mitosis and meiosis" &mdash; was his immediate answer.
         </h3>
         <h3>
            Mitosis and meiosis are two types of cell division that underpin entire biology. I created three diagrams explaining mitosis, meiosis, and the relationship between them. In 2008 I released the diagrams under the Creative Commons license. Since then, they have been adopted by 22 Wikipedia pages in 12 languages, used in teaching in Poland and the USA, and published in books. They also come up in the first line of Google image search for "<a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=mitosis&espv=2&biw=1631&bih=1318&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0CAYQ_AUoAWoVChMI7euMq43AxwIVbUfbCh0E1wIH">mitosis</a>" and "<a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=meiosis&biw=1631&bih=1318&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&sqi=2&ved=0CAYQ_AUoAWoVChMI9KL9tI3AxwIVdEfbCh0Iswq3">meiosis</a>".

<!-- PARADOXES -->
      {% if page.label == "paradoxes" %}
         <h1>Paradoxes</h1>
         <h3>
            A paradox is a seemingly self-contradicing statement, that yet can be true. There are many paradoxes in philosophy and sciences, for example: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar_paradox">the Liar Paradox</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes#Arrow_paradox">the Arrow Paradox</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_paradox">the Twin Paradox</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox">the Fermi Paradox</a>.
         </h3>
         <h3>
            "Paradoxes" is a workshop I authored and led during the Thinking in Visual Communication conference in Warsaw in 2014. Workshop task was to use visualisation to explain a selected paradox, and later to propose a speculative visual solution to that paradox. Workshop's focus was on exploring visual strategies for communicating highly complex and abstract concepts.

         <h1>Sequence Bundles</h1>
         <h3>
            Sequence Bundles is a new visualisation method for discovering and exploring sequence motifs in multiple sequence alignment data. It can be used to find and investigate patterns, correlations and variation in protein or genetic data.
         </h3>
         <h3>
            Sequence Bundles were designed at <a href="http://science-practice.com">Science Practice</a>. I initiated, managed and directed the project, establishing a collaboration with the <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/research/goldman">Goldman group</a> at the EMBL-EBI, winning Innovate UK funding for the development of an interactive bioinformatics tool, and co-authoring peer-reviewed academic publications.

         <h1>Sex Shop</h1>

            In 2006 I designed a visual brand identity for a fictional sex shop. The identity is sexy, bold and juicy.
