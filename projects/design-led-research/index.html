            How do you know if a design solution works for users?

            At <a href="http://www.science-practice.com/" title="Science Practice">Science Practice</a> and <a href="http://www.ctrl-group.com/" title="Ctrl Group">Ctrl Group</a>, where I work as a designer, we use <nobr>design-led</nobr> research methods to answer these questions.
         </h3>
         <h3>
            In 2017 I designed and led a <nobr>two-day</nobr> <nobr>hands-on</nobr> workshop introducing design students to <nobr>design-led</nobr> research. During the workshop we scoped design problems, prototyped ideas, and tested solutions with users.

            The goal of the workshop was to practice three elements of the design-led method: focus on the right design problem, efficiently build the "most minimal" prototype, and conduct reserch interviews with experts or users.
