            I created a half-day beginner-level hands-on workshop on the principles of visual design to help data scientists learn basic design skills.

            Human factors (or ergonomics) is the study of interactions between people and the things they use. It's possible to design healthy, comfortable, efficient objects and environments only if human factors are well considered.

         <h3>
            Same with designing entire workspaces. In 2006 I conducted a human factors evaluation of a conference room for a pharma company based in Warsaw. I analysed key conflicts between users, architecture, and office equipment, and made a list of recommendations for improvements. The recommendations were aimed at significantly improving human factors quality of the conference room, while keeping the extent of changes to minimum.

In close collaboration with their senior scientists I developed an illustration kit for building scientific visualisations of their anti-cancer T cell therapy. <!--technology. Informed by user research done with Immunocore's scientists I also built a set of modular templates for their conference posters and presentations.

            Since then, Immunocore has started clinical trials for their ImmTAC cancer treatment, and made a series of huge business deals with top pharma players becoming one of the brightest biotech star in the UK.
