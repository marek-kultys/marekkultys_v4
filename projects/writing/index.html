         <h1>Design Writing</h1>
         <h3>
            Writing is an important part of my design practice. I use it to capture and explore ideas for myself, and to share ideas with others.
         </h3>
         <h3>
            In 2015–2016 I worte for the <a href="http://2plus3d.pl/" title="2+3D design magazine website"><span class="nowrap">2+3d</span> Polish Design Quarterly</a> covering a range of design topics, from open licenses to synthetic biology. I also wrote and illustrated a series of posts on the <a href="http://www.science-practice.com/blog/" title="Science Practice blog">Science Practice blog</a> about extraterrestrial communication.</h3>

            In winter 2014–2015 I wrote a series of three posts on the Science Practice blog in my run-up to presentating at the 'Communicating Across the Cosmos' <a href="https://communicating.seti.org/" title="Communicating Across the Cosmos workshop website">workshop</a> organised by the SETI Institute in Mountain View, CA.

            The posts introduce the theory behind my <a href="/projects/lingua-extraterrestris" title="Lingua Extraterrestris project page">MA thesis</a> and provide an outline of the topics I discussed at the SETI Institute.
