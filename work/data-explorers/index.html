<h1>Visual Design for Data Explorers</h1>

<h3>
   Data scientists create new tools for exploring and making sense of huge sets of data generated by data-driven sciences (for example genomics or population health). Visualisation is often a key component of those tools. Yet, many data scientists lack important design skills to make good visualisation choices.
</h3>
<h3>
   I created a half-day hands-on workshop on the principles of visual design for data scientists. I taught it at two IEEEVis conferences in <a href="http://ieeevis.org/year/2012/tutorial/visweek/good-practice-visual-communication-design-scientific-and-data-visualizati">2012 (Seattle, WA)</a> and <a href="http://ieeevis.org/year/2013/tutorial/visweek/visualization-data-visual-interpretation-data-hands-design-tutorial">2013 (Atlanta, GA)</a>. The workshop includes a 90-minute background talk followed by a 120-minute sketching exercise, and a 30-minute discussion.
