         I'm a Designer at <a href="http://science-practice.com">Science Practice</a>, where I work on data visualisation and interaction projects. At Science Practice I led our work on <a href="/work/sequence-bundles/">Sequence Bundles</a>, helped conduct research for <a href="http://science-practice.com/projects/longitude/">challenge prizes</a>, and spoke at <a href="https://twitter.com/ukhealthcamp">workshops</a> and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Cambridge-Visualization-of-Biological-Information-Meetup/">meetups</a>.

      <h3>
         I also work at <a href="http://www.sp-ee.net">SP+EE</a>, where we design and research healthcare products and experiences. At SP+EE I design mobile interactions, user experiences, and patient education/training materials.

         In 2013 I advised the <a href="http://2013.igem.org/Team:UCL_E">UCL iGEM:E team</a> on a lab-in-the-box project. In 2014 we started building the <a href="/work/bento-lab/">bento-lab</a>. Until the end of 2014, I led bento's product design and brand development work, and very early user research.
      </h3>
      <h3>
         Since 2012 I've been designing and running hands-on design workshops which covered topics such as: <a href="/work/data-explorers/">visualising data</a>, <a href="/work/paradoxes/">visualising paradoxes</a>, and using visualisation for speculation.
      </h3>
      <h3>
         In 2011 I wrote my <a href="/work/lingua-extraterrestris/">MA thesis</a> about CETI &mdash; Communication with Extraterrestrial Intelligence. In my research I tried to find out if information theory and science fiction can help us better understand CETI... <a href="/work/lingua-extraterrestris/#conclusions">I found it can</a>.
      </h3>
      <h3>
         From time to time I write <a href="/works/2plus3d/">about design</a>. I talk at conferences and workshops, and sometimes guest teach at universities (for example at City University in London and MassArt in Boston, MA).
