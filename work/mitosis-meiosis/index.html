<h1>Mitosis and Meiosis</h1>

<h3>
   "What is the most complex thing in biology that students have trouble understanding"? I asked this question to my former high-school biology teacher, Dr W&#322;odzimierz W&#243;jcik, when we started a collaboration project to redesign visualisation aids he used in his class. "Mitosis and meiosis" &mdash; was his immediate answer.
</h3>
<h3>
   Mitosis and meiosis are two types of cell division that underpin entire biology. I created three diagrams explaining mitosis, meiosis, and the relationship between them. In 2008 I released the diagrams under the Creative Commons license. Since then, they have been adopted by 22 Wikipedia pages in 12 languages, used in teaching in Poland and the USA, and published in books. They also come up in the first line of Google image search for "mitosis" and "meiosis".
