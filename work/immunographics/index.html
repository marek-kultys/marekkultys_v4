<h1>Immunographics</h1>

<h3>
   In 2011-2013 I worked with Immunocore to redesign and improve the ways they communicate their work outside the company. In close collaboration with their senior scientists I developed an illustration kit for building graphic visualisations of their T-cell therapy technology. Informed by user research done with Immunocore's scientists I also built a set of modular templates for their conference posters and presentations. Finally, I also designed a new logo for Immunocore.

<h3>
   Since then, Immunocore has started clinical trials for their ImmTAC cancer treatment and made a series of huge business deals with top pharma players, becoming one of the most prominent biotech companies in the UK.
