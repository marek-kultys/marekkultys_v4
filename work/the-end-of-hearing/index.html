         I was inspired by my research into wireless and <a href="../lingua-extraterrestris">extraterrestrial communication</a> to work on a project in which I could look into non-visual forms of communication.

      <h4>
         I wrote three science-fiction stories exploring the future of human hearing in the age of aural overstimulation. The first one, "Artificial Silense", tells the story of an inventor who created a device for regulating human hearing using ototoxic (damaging to hearing) antibiotics. The second story, "Voices inside my Head", is about speculative human ability to listen directly to radio waves through a receiver implanted in between one's inner ear and the brain. The third story, "Blasting!", explores popular impact of a new technology, which allows to reverse hearing damage &mdash; sound conditioning.
