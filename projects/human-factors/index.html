         <h3>
            Human factors (or ergonomics) is the study of interactions between people and the things they use. It's possible to design healthy, comfortable, efficient objects and workspaces only if human factors are well considered.
         </h3>
         <h3>
            In 2007 I conducted a human factors evaluation of a conference room for a <nobr>Warsaw-based</nobr> pharma company. I identified key conflicts between architecture, equipment, and the users, and made recommendations for human factors improvements.

            There is a lot of tools for designing with human factors in mind. I created <nobr>1:10</nobr> human dummy CAD figures: the 5th, 50th and 95th percentile of female and male population in Poland. I used two outmost dummies (female 5th and male 95th percentile) in this project. Designs that are suitable for both these extreme sizes will also be suitable for the majority of the population.

            People have unique shapes and sizes. Yet, <nobr>mass-produced</nobr> office chairs usually come in one size to fit all. In my human factors evaluation I checked chair suitability for users larger than female 5th percentile and smaller than male 95th percentile.

            I recommended following changes to improve the ergonomics of seatings:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>Reduce seatings's depth to allow users to sit deeper for better lumbar support,
            <li>Improve seating's <nobr>front-edge</nobr> profile and decrease seating's height to remove pressure on users' lower thigh arteries,
            <li>Reduce table top's thickness to allow chairs to be moved fully underneath it.
