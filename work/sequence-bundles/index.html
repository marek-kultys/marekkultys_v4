<h1>Sequence Bundles</h1>

<h3>
   Sequence Bundles is a new visualisation method for discovering and exploring sequence motifs in multiple sequence alignment data. It can be used to find and investigate patterns, correlations and variation in protein or genetic data.
</h3>
<h3>
   Sequence Bundles were designed at <a href="http://science-practice.com">Science Practice</a>. I initiated, managed and directed the project, establishing a collaboration with the <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/research/goldman">Goldman group</a> at the EMBL-EBI, winning Innovate UK funding for the development of an interactive bioinformatics tool, and co-authoring peer-reviewed academic publications.
