      <h4>A paradox is a seemingly self-contradicting statement that, yet, can be true. There are many paradoxes in philosophy and sciences, for example: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar_paradox">the&nbsp;Liar&nbsp;Paradox</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes#Arrow_paradox">the&nbsp;Arrow&nbsp;Paradox</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_paradox">the&nbsp;Twin&nbsp;Paradox</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox">the&nbsp;Fermi&nbsp;Paradox</a>. Some of them have already been solved. Other still remain to be explained.</h4>

      <h4>A story or a visualisation is often used to explain a paradox &mdash; both help bring abstract concepts underlying a paradox to more human and understandable terms.</h4>

      <h4>The workshop had two parts. In the first part, workshop participants selected a paradox and worked in groups to create a visualisation that could be used to present the contradition in that paradox to another person.</h4>

      <h4>Explaining a paradox is not easy &mdash; it takes generations of logicians to come up with a sound solution, if one exists at all. In the second part of the workshop, participants tried to come up with a speculative solution to the selected paradox, and to visualise it.</h4>
