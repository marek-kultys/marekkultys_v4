         <h1>Sex Shop</h1>
         <h3>
            In 2006 I designed a visual brand identity for a fictional sex shop. The identity is sexy, bold and juicy.

            The logo alludes to sexuality through the use of colours and typography. Colours are rich black (like leather or latex accessories used in sex games) and bright pink (like silicon sex toys). The focal point of the logo are letters X and O intersecting in a very unambiguous way.

            The logo is very erotic but not osbscene, graphic, or too explicit. Sexual references are subtle. The identity is public space friendly, which has always been a difficult balance to find in the erotic market.

            Since I have published the logo online, I saw a lot of ebay auctions, social media profiles and web marketing that used the logo without my permission. This is obviously illegal, but insead of fighting it I decided to enjoy it as a token of logo's popularity.
