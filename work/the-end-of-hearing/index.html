      <h4>
         When I moved to London, I was surprised by the levels of noise experienced in everyday life in the city. Inspired by this and my previous research into <a href="/work/lingua-extraterrestris">CETI</a>, I created The End of Hearing &mdash; a collection of three science-fiction stories designed to elicit viewers' reactions towards possible futures of hearing.

      <h4>
         The first scenario, 'Artificial Silence', is about regulating the sensitivity of hearing through the use of ototoxic antibiotics (one of their side effects is hearing damage). I designed the Otomixer which would be used to mix and dose an ototoxic compound that turns off one's hearing for a selected duration and in a set frequency range.

      <h4>
         The second scenario, 'Blasting!', explores consequences of sound conditioning &mdash; a novel medical intervention that can protect against noise truma and prevent hearing loss.

      <h4>
         The last 'Voices Inside My Head' scenario imagines a future in which humans can be augmented to sense radio communication. I created the AIR Implant as a prop for discussing this scenario &mdash; it is an actual crystal AM radio receiver tuned to 912.5 kHz (BBC Radio 5) inside a gelatine capsule. I built about 60 of those.

         I presented The End of Hearing in a public show in London in 2011. I used the scenarios and objects to provoke a discussion with my viewers about their attitudes towards hearing and noise pollution.

      <h4>
         I also had a survey with 10 questions about the perception of noise, the role of hearing in peoples' lifes, and the role of design in shaping futures. I collected replies from 65 viewers.

         And these are the results of my survey. In summary:
         <ul>
            <li>We believe that future can be shaped and that design can help us do this,</li>
            <li>We value hearing and think that we can adapt to future soundscapes,</li>
            <li>We are undecided about the role that noise plays in our lives.</li>

         I made The End of Hearing objects myself, which was great fun. The Otomixer and the plastic blister for AIR Implants was made in the old wood workshop at the <a href="http://www.arts.ac.uk/csm/">CSM</a>.

         I also used working electronic components in The End of Hearing objects, which I prototyped myself.

      <h4>
         The Otomixer houses a graphic sound equalizer. I built it from scratch using standard electronic components, such as the LM741 integrated circuit for equalization and the LM386 for amplification.

         The AIR Implant is a little crystal radio made from a germanium diode, a ceramic capacitor and an inductance coil. They were picked to resonate in 912.5 kHz (BBC Radio 5). I assembled about 60 is those little radios.
