         <h1>Human Factors</h1>
         <h3>
            Human factors (or ergonomics) is the study of interactions between people and the things they use. It's possible to design healthy, comfortable, efficient objects and workspaces only if human factors are well considered.
         </h3>
         <h3>
            In 2007 I conducted a human factors evaluation of a conference room for a <nobr>Warsaw-based</nobr> pharma company. I identified key conflicts between architecture, equipment, and the users, and made recommendations for human factors improvements.

            There is a lot of tools for designing with human factors in mind. I created <nobr>1:10</nobr> human dummy CAD figures: the 5th, 50th and 95th percentile of female and male population in Poland. I used two outmost dummies (female 5th and male 95th percentile) in this project. Designs that are suitable for both these extreme sizes will also be suitable for the majority of the population.

         <ul>
            <li>Reduce seatings's depth to allow users to sit deeper for better lumbar support,
