            I'm an interdisciplinary visual communication designer.
         </h3>
         <h3>
            I currently work on visualisation projects at <a href="http://science-practice.com">Science&nbsp;Practice</a> and design of healthcare experiences at <a href="http://sp-ee.net">SP+EE</a>. I've been leading design work for <a href="http://bento.bio">bento&bull;lab</a>. From time to time I also write, run workshops, talk at conferences, and teach.

      {% if page.label == "about" %}
         <h3>
            I am an interdisciplinary designer with over 10 years of combined experience in visual communication, user experience design, data visualisation, and designing products. Although most of my work is digital, it always stems from real-life experiences and tangible interactions with users. I am based in London and Warsaw.

         </h3>
         <h3>
            2+3d is one of the top design magazine in Central-Eastern Europe. Next to current articles about product and graphic design, it publishes texts on broader interdisciplinary topics, such as: design criticism, history of design, technology, and creative economies.

         </h3>
         <h3>
            As part of the <a href="http://www.bento.bio/team/">team</a> developing the bento&bull;lab, I was responsible for bento's identity, product design, and user experience, as well as related elements of strategy and planning. bento&bull;lab is currenty in pioneer beta-testing.

      {% if page.label == "visweek" %}
         <h1>Visual Design for Data Explorers</h1>
         <h3>
            I created a half-day beginner-level hands-on workshop on the principles of visual design to help data scientists learn basic design skills. I taught the workshop at two IEEE Vis conferences (<a href="http://ieeevis.org/year/2012/tutorial/visweek/good-practice-visual-communication-design-scientific-and-data-visualizati">2012 in Seattle</a> and <a href="http://ieeevis.org/year/2013/tutorial/visweek/visualization-data-visual-interpretation-data-hands-design-tutorial">2013 in Atlanta</a>), and to masters students at City University in London.

         <h1>Human Factors</h1>
         <h3>
            Human factors (or ergonomics) is the study of interactions between people and the things they use. It's possible to design healthy, comfortable, efficient objects and environments only if human factors are well considered.
         </h3>
         <h3>
            Same with designing entire workspaces. In 2006 I conducted a human factors evaluation of a conference room for a pharma company based in Warsaw. I analysed key conflicts between users, architecture, and office equipment, and made a list of recommendations for improvements. The recommendations were aimed at significantly improving human factors quality of the conference room, while keeping the extent of changes to minimum.

         <h3>
            In 2011&ndash;2013 I worked with Immunocore to redesign and improve the ways they communicate their work outside the company. In close collaboration with their senior scientists I developed an illustration kit for building scientific visualisations of their anti-cancer T cell therapy.
         </h3>
         <h3>
            Since then, Immunocore has started clinical trials for their ImmTAC cancer treatment, and made a series of huge business deals with top pharma players becoming one of the brightest biotech star in the UK.

         <h3>
            <a href="/img/lingua-extraterrestris/Lingua-Extraterrestris_by_Marek-Kultys.pdf">Lingua Extraterrestris</a> is my MA thesis and an exploration into the limits of communication. I'm interested in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_with_extraterrestrial_intelligence">CETI</a> &mdash; Communication with ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence &mdash; because it is the most extreme example of all communication types. My investigation looks into historical and science-fiction examples of CETI, and concludes in expanding on the seminal Drake Equation.
         </h3>
         <h3>
            I presented <a href="/img/lingua-extraterrestris/Lingua-Extraterrestris_by_Marek-Kultys.pdf">Lingua Extraterrestris</a> at two astrobiology conferences and in a <a href="http://communicating.seti.org/">workshop</a> at the SETI Institute in California.

         <h1>Mitosis and Meiosis</h1>
         <h3>
            "What is the most complex thing in biology that students have trouble understanding"? I asked this question to my former high-school biology teacher, Dr W&#322;odzimierz W&#243;jcik, when we started a collaboration project to redesign visualisation aids he used in his class. "Mitosis and meiosis" &mdash; was his immediate answer.
         </h3>
         <h3>
            Mitosis and meiosis are two types of cell division that underpin entire biology. I created three diagrams explaining mitosis, meiosis, and the relationship between them. In 2008 I released the diagrams under the Creative Commons <span class="fontello-close-icon"><i class="icon-cc"></i></span><span class="fontello-close-icon"><i class="icon-cc-by"></i></span><span class="fontello-close-icon"><i class="icon-cc-sa"></i></span> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC BY-SA 3.0</a> license.

            Sequence Bundles is a new visualisation method for discovering and exploring sequence motifs in multiple sequence alignment data. It can be used to find and investigate patterns, correlations and variation in protein or genetic data.
         </h3>
         <h3>
            Sequence Bundles were designed at <a href="http://science-practice.com">Science Practice</a>. I initiated, managed and directed the project, establishing a collaboration with the <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/research/goldman">Goldman group</a> at the EMBL-EBI, winning Innovate UK funding for the development of an interactive bioinformatics tool, and co-authoring peer-reviewed academic publications.

         <h1>Workshops</h1>
         <h3>
            Since 2012, I have been designing and leading design workshops. Themes are usually focused around visualisation and there is often an element of hands-on sketching and drawing where  participants conceptualise their ideas and discuss them with others.

      {% if page.label == "writing" %}
         <h1>Writing</h1>
         <h3>
            Designers need to write and communicate their ideas in words, as well as they do with images. I have written popular articles for design magazines and academic papers for peer-reviewed journals. I write in English and Polish. In the future, I would like to translate one of the major treatises on visual perception from Polish to English.
