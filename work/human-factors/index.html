            There is a myriad of tools that help measure and design with human factors in mind. I created vectorised 1:10 human dummy figures: the 5th, 50th and 95th percentile of female and male population in Poland. I used two outmost dummies coloured in grey (female 5th percentile and male 95th percentile) in my human factors evaluation &mdash; designs that are suitable for those extreme sizes, will also be suitable for the majority of the population.

            People come in different shapes and sizes. Yet, chairs are usually made in one size to fit all. In my human factors evaluation I looked into chair suitability for everyone between small women (5th percentile) and large men (95th percentile). Sitting is a dynamic activity, so I also took into account various positions in which people sit during a meeting.

            Eight modular tables used in the conference room can be arranged to sit 14 people. I used anthropometric charts by Henry Dreyfuss Associates [source] to evaluate user comfort zones and find work area conflicts in three possible sitting configurations.

            I summarised my human factors analysis in a list of recommended changes to improve the ergonomics of the conference room:
            <ul>
               <li>Reduce the depth of the chair to allow smaller users to sit deeper with full back support,
               <li>Improve the profile of seating's front-edge and decrease seating's height to reduce the pressure on smallest users' lower thigh arteries,
               <li>Reduce the thickness of the table top to allow chairs to be moved fully underneath it<!--  (previously the armrests hit the edge of the table) -->.
            </ul>
         </p>

               <li>Increase table width to aviod conflicts between users' working areas,
               <li>Move doorway entrance to the corner of the room to avoid clashes with the table,
               <li>Change the door to outward-opening to adhere to fire safety regulations, and aviod clashes with the chairs,
               <li>Mount all electricity/media installations at 75cm height to improve accessibility for taller users,
               <li>Other ergonomics changes.
