            The logo alludes to sexuality with colour and typography. Colours used in the logo are rich black (leather clothing used in sexual games) bright pink (silicon erotic toys). Letter X enters letter O in a very sexual way.

         <h4>
            The logo is very erotic, but not osbscene or too literal. The sexual references are kept subtle. That's wthi there should be no problem to use this identity also in public spaces, which thus far used to be a taboo.
