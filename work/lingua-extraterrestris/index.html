<h1>Lingua Extraterrestris</h1>

<h3>
   Are we alone in the Universe?

<h3>
   "Lingua Extraterrestris" is my MA thesis and an exploration into the limits of communication. I'm interested in CETI &mdash; communication with extarterrestrial intelligence &mdash; because it is the most extreme example of all communication types. My investigation looks at historical and science-fiction examples of CETI, and discusses them in relation to prerequisites for any communication encounter: channel, contact, context, and code. In conclusion, I suggest to expand on the famous Drake equation using these four parameters.
