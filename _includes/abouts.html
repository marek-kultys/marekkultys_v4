         <h3>
            I'm a visual information designer. Currently, I work on visualisation projects at <a href="http://science-practice.com"><nobr>Science Practice</nobr></a>, and design healthcare experiences at <a href="http://www.sp-ee.net">SP+EE</a>. I led design work for the <a href="http://bento.bio">bento•lab</a>. I also write, design workshops, give talks, and teach.

         <h1>Writing for 2+3d</h1>
         <h3>
            In 2015 I wrote three articles for <a href="http://2plus3d.pl/"><nobr>2+3d</nobr> Polish Design Quarterly</a>. <nobr>2+3d</nobr> is one of the top design magazines in Central Europe. Besides the general topics such as graphic and product design, <nobr>2+3d</nobr> also publishes articles about history of design, design criticism, technology, and creative economies.

         <h3>
            <a href="http://www.bento.bio/bento-lab/">bento•lab</a> is a powerful, personal <nobr>lab-in-the-box</nobr> kit that enables scientists, biohackers, artists and all curious minds to use essential laboratory tools anywhere and any time.
         </h3>
         <h3>
            At bento I worked on bento's visual identity, product design, and user experiences, as well as related elements of strategy and planning. Currently, the bento•lab is in pioneer beta phase.

         <h1>Visual Design for Data Explorers</h1>
         <h3>
            I created a <nobr>hands-on</nobr> workshop on the principles of visual design to help data scientists learn and practice design skills. I taught the workshop at two IEEE Vis conferences (in <a href="http://ieeevis.org/year/2012/tutorial/visweek/good-practice-visual-communication-design-scientific-and-data-visualizati">2012 in Seattle</a> and in <a href="http://ieeevis.org/year/2013/tutorial/visweek/visualization-data-visual-interpretation-data-hands-design-tutorial">2013 in Atlanta</a>), and to university students in London.

         <h1>Human Factors</h1>
         <h3>
            Human factors (or ergonomics) is the study of interactions between people and the things they use. It's possible to design healthy, comfortable, efficient objects and workspaces only if human factors are well considered.
         </h3>
         <h3>
            In 2007 I conducted a human factors evaluation of a conference room for a <nobr>Warsaw-based</nobr> pharma company. I identified key conflicts between architecture, equipment, and the users, and made recommendations for human factors improvements.

            In 2011–2013 I worked with <a href="http://www.immunocore.com">Immunocore</a> to redesign and improve the ways they communicate their work outside the company. In collaboration with Immunocore's scientists I created visualisations explaining how their <nobr>anti-cancer</nobr> ImmTAC technology works.

         <h3>
            <a href="/img/lingua-extraterrestris/Lingua-Extraterrestris_by_Marek-Kultys.pdf">Lingua Extraterrestris</a> is my MA thesis and an exploration into the limits of communication. I'm interested in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_with_extraterrestrial_intelligence">CETI</a> — Communication with Extraterrestrial Intelligence — because it is the most extreme example of all communication types. My investigation looks into historical and <nobr>science-fiction</nobr> examples of CETI, and concludes in expanding on the seminal Drake Equation.
         </h3>
         <h3>
            I presented Lingua Extraterrestris at two astrobiology conferences and in a <a href="http://communicating.seti.org/">workshop</a> at the SETI Institute in California.

         <h1>Mitosis and Meiosis</h1>
         <h3>
            Mitosis and meiosis are types of biological cell division. I created three diagrams explaining mitosis and meiosis visually, on which I collaborated closely with my high school teacher, Dr Włodzimierz Wójcik. In 2008 I published the diagrams in Wikipedia under the Creative Commons. Since 2009 they have also been used in teaching in Poland and in the US.

            "Paradoxes" is a visualisation workshop for curious designers that I authored and led in 2014. We focused on communicating and explaining some of the most abstract thought exercises and complex phenomena — logical and scientific paradoxes.

         </h3>
         <h3>
            We designed Sequence Bundles at <a href="http://science-practice.com">Science Practice</a>. I initiated, managed, and directed the project, set up a collaboration with the Goldman group at the European Bioinformatics Institute, secured funding from Innovate UK, and <nobr>co-authored</nobr> our academic articles.

            The End of Hearing is a design fictions exploration of possible worlds in which our soundscapes have radically changed. It is a series of three <nobr>science-fiction</nobr> stories told in different media: writing, film, narrative objects, and performance.
