      <h4>Communication with Extraterrestrial Intelligence (the active branch of SETI) has always been focused on the question "What should we say to them once we encounter them?"</h4>

      <h4>I looked at both factual (historical) as well as science-fiction examples of communicating with extraterrestrials to understand the similarities and differences with the communication known to us on Earth.</h4>

      <h4>I suggested expanding one of Drake's original variables, C, to take into account four factors that are central to information theory and linguistic models of communication: Channel, Contact, Context and Code.</h4>
