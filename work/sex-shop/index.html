            The logo alludes to sexuality through use of colours and typography. Colours are rich black (leather or latex accessories used in sex games) and bright pink (silicon sex toys). Letter X intersects with letter O in a very unambiguous way too.

            The logo is very erotic, but not osbscene, graphic or too explicit. The sexual references are subtle. The identity is public space friendly, which has always been a difficult balance to strike.

            Since I have published the logo online, I saw a lot of ebay auctions, social media profiles and web marketing that used the logo without my permission. This is obviously illegal, but insead of fighting it I decided to enjoy it as a token of logo's popularity.
