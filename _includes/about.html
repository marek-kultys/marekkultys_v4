         <h3>
            2+3d is one of the top design magazine in Central-Eastern Europe. Next to current articles about product and graphic design, it publishes texts on broader interdisciplinary topics, such as: design criticism, history of design, technology, and creative economies.

         <h1>Visual Design for Data Explorers</h1>
         <h3>
            Data scientists work with huge datasets generated in, for example, genomics or social media. They often build software tools to help them visualise and understand those huge sets of data. Yet, many data scientists lack basic design skills to make good visualisation choices.
         </h3>
         <h3>
            I created a half-day beginner-level hands-on workshop on the principles of visual design to help data scientists learn basic design skills. I taught the workshop at two IEEE Vis conferences (<a href="http://ieeevis.org/year/2012/tutorial/visweek/good-practice-visual-communication-design-scientific-and-data-visualizati">2012 in Seattle</a> and <a href="http://ieeevis.org/year/2013/tutorial/visweek/visualization-data-visual-interpretation-data-hands-design-tutorial">2013 in Atlanta</a>), and to masters students at City University in London.

            Human factors (or ergonomics) is the study of interactions between people and the things they use. It's possible to design healthy, comfortable, efficient objects and environments only if human factors are well considered.
         </h3>
         <h3>
            Same with designing entire workspaces. In 2006 I conducted a human factors evaluation of a conference room for a pharma company based in Warsaw. I analysed key conflicts between users, architecture, and office equipment, and made a list of recommendations for improvements. The recommendations were aimed at significantly improving human factors quality of the conference room, while keeping the extent of changes to minimum.

            In 2011&ndash;2013 I worked with Immunocore to redesign and improve the ways they communicate their work outside the company. In close collaboration with their senior scientists I developed an illustration kit for building scientific visualisations of their anti-cancer T cell therapy. <!--technology. Informed by user research done with Immunocore's scientists I also built a set of modular templates for their conference posters and presentations. Finally, I also designed a new logo for Immunocore.-->

         <h3>
            Since then, Immunocore has started clinical trials for their ImmTAC cancer treatment, and made a series of huge business deals with top pharma players becoming one of the brightest biotech star in the UK.

         <h3>
            "Lingua Extraterrestris" is my MA thesis and an exploration into the limits of communication. I'm interested in CETI &mdash; communication with extarterrestrial intelligence &mdash; because it is the most extreme example of all communication types. My investigation looks into historical and science-fiction examples of CETI<!--, and discusses them in relation to prerequisites for any communication encounter: channel, contact, context, and code. In conclusion, I suggest to expand on the famous Drake equation using these four parameters.--> and concludes in expanding on the seminal Drake Equation.
         </h3>
         <h3>
            I presented "Lingua Extraterrestris" at two astrobiology conferences and a <a href="http://communicating.seti.org/">workshop</a> at the SETI Institute in California.

            "What is the most complex thing in biology that students have trouble understanding"? I asked this question to my former high-school biology teacher, Dr W&#322;odzimierz W&#243;jcik, when we started a collaboration project to redesign visualisation aids he used in his class. "Mitosis and meiosis" &mdash; was his immediate answer.
         </h3>
         <h3>
            Mitosis and meiosis are two types of cell division that underpin entire biology. I created three diagrams explaining mitosis, meiosis, and the relationship between them.

         <h3>
            Sequence Bundles were designed at <a href="http://science-practice.com">Science Practice</a>.
