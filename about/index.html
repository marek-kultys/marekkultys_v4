         In 2013 I advised the <a href="http://2013.igem.org/Team:UCL_E" title="iGEM project website for Darwin Toolbox, the predecessor of bento•lab">UCL iGEM:E team</a> on a <nobr>lab-in-the-box</nobr> project. In 2014 we started building the <a href="/projects/bento-lab/" title="bento•lab lab-in-the-box project"><nobr>bento•lab</nobr></a>. Until the end of 2014, I led bento's product design and brand development work, and very early user research.

         In 2011 I wrote my <a href="/projects/lingua-extraterrestris/" title="Lingua Extraterrestris research project">MA thesis</a> about CETI — Communication with Extraterrestrial Intelligence. In my research I tried to find out if information theory and science fiction can help us better understand CETI... <nobr><a href="/projects/lingua-extraterrestris/#conclusions" title="Lingua Extraterrestris research project - conclusions">I found it can</a></nobr>. In March 2016 I joined the <a href="http://metiinternational.org/advisors" title="Advisory Council webpage on METI International website">Advisory Council at METI International</a> — a new organisation leading global efforts in messaging extraterrestrial intelligence.
