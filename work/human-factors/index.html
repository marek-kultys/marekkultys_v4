<h1>Human Factors</h1>

<h3>
   Human factors (or ergonomics) is the study of interactions between people and the things they use. It's impossible to design healthy, comfortable, efficient objects and environments without considering human factors.
</h3>
<h3>
   That's also the case with workspaces. In 2006 I conducted a human factors evaluation of a conference room for a Warsaw-based company. I took measurements and analysed key conflicts between the users, the architecture, and the equipment, and summarised my conclusions in a list of specific recommendations. Suggested improvements were aimed at significantly improving the human factors quality of the conference room, while keeping the number of changes to minimum.
