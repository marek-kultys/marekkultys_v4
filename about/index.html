         In 2011 I wrote my <a href="/projects/lingua-extraterrestris/" title="Lingua Extraterrestris research project">MA thesis</a> about CETI — Communication with Extraterrestrial Intelligence. In my research I tried to find out if information theory and science fiction can help us better understand CETI... <nobr><a href="/projects/lingua-extraterrestris/#conclusions" title="Lingua Extraterrestris research project - conclusions">I found it can</a></nobr>. In March 2016 I joined the <a href="http://metiinternational.org/advisors" title="Advisory Council webpage on METI International website">Advisory Council at METI International</a> — a new organisation leading global efforts in messaging extraterrestrial intelligence.
