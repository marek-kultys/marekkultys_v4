<h1>bento&bull;lab</h1>

<h3>
   <a href="http://www.bento.bio/bento-lab/">bento&bull;lab</a> is a personal box-sized biological laboratory. It is equipped with a powerful 3d-printed centrifuge, a mini PCR machine, and a gel electrophoresis unit with an LED transilluminator. Everything fits in a portable A4-sized box.

<h3>
   As part of the team developing the bento&bull;lab, I was responsible for bento's brand identity, user experience design, product design, as well as some elements of strategy and planning. Currently, the bento&bull;lab is in pioneer beta-testing.
